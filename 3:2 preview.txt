For this argument preview, I chose to focus on some of the images I want to pull from for my final and play around with some different effects, though I’m not married to anything I have right now. For the background, I’m thinking I want the road ahead to look dark, potentially stormy, to represent post-graduation when loans start accumulating more interest and what not, and just the challenges with them after graduation. To initiate that idea, I decided to play around with a gradient and have the top half become darker, but I would love to learn of a more interesting way to do this.I also selected the outline of the grads throwing their cap in the air for a layer. I decided to fill in the shape with black, because I think that’s more conducive to what I want to do with my text and indicate that millions of people take out loans. I’m open to playing around with other ways to fill those outlines, maybe with some kind of representation of how much money people take out, or a visual statistic like the one example we saw. I’m pretty sure I also embossed that layer as well, just to play around, but I’m not sure how much I like the look of it.The only other layers I have right now are two road barriers, which are supposed to replicate the way loans can alter a trajectory post-graduation, maybe even going so far as to completely limit certain possibilities. I’m thinking that would be a more interesting place to lay down some visual representation of some stats, but I’m hesitant because they cover such a small surface area.For next time, I’m going to start parsing through some statistics and playing around with different font options.
