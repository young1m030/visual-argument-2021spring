Hi all! Thank you for taking the time to look at my project, "The Silent Barrier," which addresses how the extensive amount of student loan debt holds countless students back from pursuing their life goals to the fullest extent. I chose a layer of students at their college graduation as my baseline, and after cropping their outline decided to fill it in with black to reflect the ubiquity of student loans among millennials and Gen Z. The image included the caps they were throwing in the air in the symmetrical curve as they currently appear in the photo, so I decided to keep it that way to build some interesting movement/rhthym. I then added an outer glow to make them stand out from the background.

I placed the students layer over a background with a long road to represent the journey ahead. The I layed a gradient over that so it was dark at the top, reflecting the threat that arrives post-graduation when loans start accumulating more interest and what not, and just the challenges with them after graduation. I then have two kind of half-layers in the form of the road guards/barriers in front of my students that blocks them from moving forward.

The other major component of this project consists of the layers of text. After updating the statistics to find the most reputable/updated data, I decided to keep the font sizes fairly similar, because several people indicated that their eyes first went to that figure when it was bigger and in the middle of the screen. Other than that, I chose a font that I read reflected a more serious tone, and decided to keep it all one font. I pulled the orange color from the background. 

Overall, I'm very happy with this how this turned out. I really liked the color scheme I was able to put together, and I think the argument comes through very clearly.
